#Draft Web Design Standards Research Strategy

##Overview
User research will be a core aspect of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards project as it's the main source of feedback and inspiration for future product development. We want to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods so we have active and passive research going on a frequent basis. By conducting user research directly with users of the USWDS, we are able to get direct feedback on how the the standards are working for people when they encounter a site that's using it.

We are also able to provide user research services to teams that are using the USWDS, which are detailed below. These services will be priced and scoped so teams around the federal government are able to easily engage with us and find ways to improve their product. This benefits us as well as we get feedback on the various patterns and frameworks present in the design standards themselves.

##Analytics Reporting
_Quarterly Report Outs_

Once a quarter the metrics displayed on https://standards.usa.gov/about-our-work/ will be updated to reflect the recent traffic and usage of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. We will use this information to identify future improvements to the design patterns. You can use these metrics to help justify the adoption and continued use of the USWDS.

_Dependencies_
* Your team has defined the metrics and funnels you want to track and report out on
* One of your team members must be familiar enough with web analytics to set up the tracking and reporting

##User Research Activities
_Recruitment_

One of our challenges is knowing who is interested in being part of our user research. To resolve this, we will implement several channels for federal designers and developers to signal their interest and provide their contact information to us. This will allow us to conduct research in a timely fashion.

_Potential Methods_
* Re-activate the screener to intercept users of standards.usa.gov
* Provide a "Contact Us" feature on standards.usa.gov 
* Perform outreach via federal listservs and other digital channels to invite participation and collect contact information.

_Digital Service Team Remote Interviews_

One of the most consistent ways we have collected feedback from our users has been by conducting remote interviews with digital service teams around the federal government. This has allowed us to collect direct feedback and suggestions for how to improve the product. Given this success, the team aims to continue using this method on a frequent (1 - 2 interviews a month) basis.

_Bi-annual Contextual Inquiries_

Twice a year, the team will schedule a round of in-person interviews with teams around the federal government to meet with and observe how teams have been using, or would like to be using, the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. The information gathered during these "contextual inquires" will ensure that the product is continuously delivering what federal teams and the general public need.

_Open House Events_

The team will host open house events at the GSA Headquarters in Washington D.C. During these events, the team will conduct training presentations and allow teams using the USWDS to showcase their products and explain how they've implemented the Standards. These events will be open to anyone in federal government.

##Research as a Service Offerings

_Usability Testing_

The work of the team should be tested early and often. To meet this goal, once a month Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus leo tellus, tincidunt vel tellus at, gravida sollicitudin ante. Etiam auctor faucibus nibh et viverra. Praesent ligula augue, rhoncus vel turpis vitae, ornare molestie diam. Suspendisse potenti. Nullam rutrum accumsan libero. In mauris est, condimentum et ex in, bibendum pharetra leo. Phasellus mattis leo ac mi facilisis, sed cursus nunc convallis. Proin id vehicula turpis.
