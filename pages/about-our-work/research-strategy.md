#Draft Web Design Standards Research Strategy

##Overview
User research will be a core aspect of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards project as its the main source of feedback and inspiration for future product development. The team wants to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods so we have active and passive research going on a frequent basis. By conducting user research directly with users of the USWDS, we are able to get direct feedback on how the the standards are working for people when they encounter a site that's using the USWDS.

The team is also able to provide user research services to teams that are using the USWDS, which are detailed below. These services will be priced and scoped so teams around the federal government is able to easily engage with the product team and find ways to improve their product. This is a benefit to the product team as well as we get feedback on the various patterns and frameworks present in the design standards themselves.

##Analytics Reporting
_Quarterly Report Outs_

Once a quarter the metrics displayed on https://standards.usa.gov/about-our-work/ will be updated to reflect the recent traffic and usage of the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. This information will be used to inform the product team on where to focus when it comes to future improvements to the design patterns and the metrics can be used by our users to help justify the adoption and continued use of the USWDS.

_Dependencies_
* The team has defined the metrics and funnels they want to track and report out on
* A team member must be familiar enough with web analytics to set up the tracking and reporting

##User Research Activities
_Recruitment_

One of the challenges the team faces is having an easy to access list of people and teams that are interested in engaging with us when we go out to conduct user research. To resolve this, the team will implement several channels which will allows federal designers and developers to pass on their contact information to us so we can contact them in the future. This will streamline the teams ability to conduct research in a timely fashion.

_Potential Methods_
* Re-activate the screener to intercept users of standards.usa.gov
* Provide a "Contact Us" feature to standards.usa.gov for users to users
* Perform outreach via federal listservs and other digital channels to collect contact information.

_Digital Service Team Remote Interviews_

One of the most consistent ways the team has collected feedback from our users to date has been by conducting remote interviews with digital service teams around the federal government. This has allowed us to collect direct feedback and suggestions for how to improve the product. Given this success, the team aims to continue using this method on a frequent (1 - 2 interviews a month) basis.

_Bi-annual Contextual Inquiries_

Twice a year, the team will schedule a round of contextual inquires with teams around the federal government to meet with them in person to observe how teams have been using, or would like to be using, the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. These session will be casual in nature to meet the needs to the teams we will meet with. The information gathered during these contextual inquires will inform the product roadmap to ensure that the product is continuously delivering what federal teams and the general public needs.

_Open House Events_

The team will host open house events at the GSA Headquarters in Washington D.C. During these event, the team will present training presentations and allow teams using the USWDS to showcase their product and explain how they've implemented the Standards. These events will be open to anyone in federal government.

##Research as a Service Offerings

_Usability Testing_

The work of the team should be tested early and often. To meet this goal, once a month Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Proin id vehicula turpis.
