### Platform based themes

Teams using the U.S. Web Design Standards have posted themes for both Wordpress and Drupal that allow you to get started easier and faster. While these thees might not be full featured, they should give your team a strong foundation to work from as you begin to use the Standards.

#### WDS Wordpress theme from Broadcasting Bord of Governers' open sourced:
